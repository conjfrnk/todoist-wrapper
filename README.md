# todoist-wrapper
Electron Wrapper for [Todoist](https://app.todoist.com). I made my own because [the Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/com.todoist.Todoist) was 5+ months old. So outdated, in fact, that it couldn't run on my computer anymore.

Also, this has Wayland support.

## Install
Use `install.sh` to install the binary file. I wish there was a way to be able to use `npm install -g conjfrnk/todoist-wrapper` or something like that, but I've experienced failure after failure with that so I'm sticking with what I know.

## Package Managers
- Gentoo coming soon
- Fedora coming eventually
- Debian coming at some point
- Arch too? Sometime down the road

## Develop
`npm install` to install dependencies

`npm run start` to run the app
